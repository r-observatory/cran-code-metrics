# tests/testthat/test-dataset-contract.R: the dataset column specs against the
# fields the analyzer actually emits.
#
# .write_datasets_normalized() routes a dataset record into the three tables by
# name: intersect(names(.DATASET_CONTENT_COLS), names(df)) and its two siblings.
# Nothing tied those lists to what the analyzer emits, so the two drifted in
# both directions at once, silently. A field the analyzer added and no spec
# declares is computed, carried across a fork, and then dropped on the way into
# SQLite. A column a spec declares and the analyzer never emits is shipped as
# public data that is NULL for every package in the archive.
#
# This test is the tie. It runs the real binary over the committed fixture
# package and compares the union of keys on its dataset records against the
# three specs, in both directions. The fixtures exist to make that union wide:
# every object under fixtures/dataset-contract/pkg/data is there to make one
# family of fields come back, and fixtures/dataset-contract/make.R regenerates
# them.
