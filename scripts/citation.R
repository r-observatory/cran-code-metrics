# scripts/citation.R: reading inst/CITATION out of a released version.
# Dependency: config.R, context.R must be sourced first.

#' Whether a released version ships the file utils::citation() reads.
#'
#' Computed from the version's file list rather than from extraction, so a
#' package that ships a citation we failed to read is never reported as a
#' package that ships none. inst/CITATION only: a CITATION.cff at the root is
#' the CFF standard read by repository hosts, a different file with a different
#' reader, and man/CITATION or inst/extdata/CITATION are neither.
#'
#' @param files Character vector of paths in the released version.
#' @return 1L when inst/CITATION is present, 0L otherwise.
